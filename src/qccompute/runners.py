    Run in the calculation directory without changing the parent process's working
    directory or environment. Standard error is redirected into standard output,
    and stdin is closed. Output is read until EOF, including any final text without
    a trailing newline.

    Args:
        request: The prepared command and invocation environment defaults. Input
            files must already have been written to the calculation directory.
        directory: The working directory for the child process.
        environment: Overrides applied after the inherited environment and request
            defaults. These affect only the child process.
        update_func: Optional callback accepting two strings: all captured output
            and the new output since the previous callback. For console output,
            use ``lambda all_logs, new_logs: print(new_logs, end="")``. Any remaining
            output is delivered after the child exits, including on a nonzero exit.
            No callback is made if the child produces no output.
        update_interval: Minimum seconds between live callbacks; defaults to 0.5.
            Updates are line-based, so an unterminated line waits until a newline
            or EOF. This interval is not a heartbeat. The final callback is not
            delayed by the interval.
        timeout: Seconds the program may run. When exceeded, the program and every
            process it started are killed, and ``error`` holds a
            ``ProgramTimeoutError``; output produced so far is kept.

    Returns:
        Native execution observations with merged output in ``stdout``, the working directory, and the return code. Launch, reading,
        or callback exceptions are recorded in ``error`` and ``traceback``, with
        output read so far retained. A nonzero exit is returned for the caller to
        interpret, allowing decoding of partial scientific results.

    On POSIX the program runs in its own session, so a timeout or an interrupted
    caller kills the whole process tree (for example the xtb processes CREST
    starts), not just the immediate child. Scientific decoding and scratch-directory
    cleanup belong to the caller.
